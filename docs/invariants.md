# Invariants

TODO TODO TODO

this doc will contain two tables:

* One describing the invariants that define lineage validaity, and are continuously enforced by 
* Another describing publish-time constraints, which are largely about immutability

At least the first table will indicate the maturity of the enforcement mechanism, as well as where enforcement currently resides (native, portable CUE vs. language-specific helper libs)

Also, this is where the maths discussion should probably live that explains Thema is all a category theoretic construct

What are the axioms of the category Lineage?
