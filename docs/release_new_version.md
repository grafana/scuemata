# Release a new version

1. Make sure that you have [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) installed in your local.
2. Execute `make gen-release tag=your_tag` using [semantic versioning](https://goreleaser.com/limitations/semver/).
3. To be consistent, all tags should include `v` prefix (ex. v0.1.1).
